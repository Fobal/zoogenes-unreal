# ZooGenes Starter-Integration Plugin for Unreal Engine 5.2+

This plugin provides everything you need to seamlessly integrate ZooGenes—a collection of 3D characters created by PLYR CHAIN—into your Unreal Engine projects.

# Features

Quick Start: Includes starter files to get up and running with ZooGenes characters right away.

Basic UI: Includes UI functionality to showcase a list of random 50 ZooGenes.

Control Rig: Includes a control rig to easily animate the ZooGenes. It's in early version.

Full Compatibility: Designed for easy integration into both new and existing UE5 projects, c++ or blueprints only!

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate ZooGenes characters into your Unreal Engine project:

Download the Plugin: Clone or download the plugin from this repository.

Install the Plugin: Move the plugin folder into the Plugins directory of your Unreal Engine project. Create a folder with the name: "Plugins" if there is not one.

Enable the Plugin: Open your project in Unreal Engine, go to Edit > Plugins, and enable the ZooGenes Integration Plugin if it's not enabled.

Check the demo: In the Unreal Engine Editor, go to ZooGenesPlugin Content > Demo , in the plugins directory, and open the "LVL_Demo" level.

On your own: Feel free to check the functionality of each blueprint and adjust the premade ZooGene character actor to fit your project!

How it works: Basically, we set all the materials of the ZooGene to M_Empty and then we assign the materials of the selected ZooGene. This way we hide all the mesh except the parts that we need.

# Roadmap
We plan to add a starter animation kit. This plugin already includes a control rig which can be used to very easily animate the ZooGenes, but there are some improvements that can be made.

# Support
